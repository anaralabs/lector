import ResolutionComparison from "@/components/resolution-comparison.tsx";



<ResolutionComparison />

## Usage
### Using the `resolution` prop
```tsx
"use client";

import {
  CanvasLayer,
  Page,
  Pages,
  Root,
  TextLayer,
} from "@anaralabs/lector";

const ViewerResolution = () => {
  return (
    <Root
      source="/pdf/document.pdf"
      //          v------ Default is 1, but 2 is a good balance between speed and quality
      resolution={2}
    >
      <Pages className="p-4 h-full">
        <Page>
          <CanvasLayer />
          <TextLayer />
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </Root>
  );
};

export default ViewerResolution;
```

### Using the `usePdf` hook
Remember to use the `usePdf` hook inside the `Root` component.

```tsx
const resolution = usePdf((state) => state.resolution);
const setResolution = usePdf((state) => state.setResolution);
```

## Features

- Control the sharpness and quality of the PDF rendering at the cost of heavier rendering tasks.
  - 1 is the fastest render (but the lowest quality)
  - 4 is the slowest render (but the highest quality)
- Configurable through the `resolution` prop on the `Root` component or the `usePdf` hook
- Limited values from 1 to 4 to avoid freezing the browser.

## Best Practices

- Use 2 as a default value for the `resolution` prop. It's a good balance between speed and quality.
- For mobile devices, do not use a value higher than 2.
